## 🎯 Next: Phase 1 - Foundation (Week 1-2)

### Critical Path to Working MVP

#### Sprint 1.1: Database & Auth (3-4 days) - COMPLETE! ✅
**Branch:** `feature/database-auth-setup` (ready to merge)

**Tasks:**
1. ✅ ~~Choose database: Supabase~~
2. ✅ ~~Set up Drizzle ORM~~
3. ✅ ~~Create schema (10 tables created)~~
4. ✅ ~~Add NextAuth.js with Google OAuth~~
5. ✅ ~~Create login/signup pages~~
6. ⏳ Write auth tests (can be done later)

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Auth working! User needs to set up Google OAuth credentials.
**Time spent:** ~4 hours
**Next:** Set up Google OAuth credentials, test login, then merge to main

#### Sprint 1.2: Applications API - COMPLETE! ✅
**Branch:** `feature/applications-api` (ready to merge or continue with UI)

**Tasks:**
1. ✅ Build REST API endpoints (7 endpoints created)
2. ✅ Add Zod validation (comprehensive schemas)
3. ✅ Implement CRUD operations (ApplicationService)
4. ✅ Error handling (try-catch with proper status codes)
5. ⏳ API tests (can be added later)

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Full CRUD API working!
**Time spent:** ~1 hour
**Endpoints created:**
- POST /api/applications
- GET /api/applications (with filters, search, pagination)
- GET /api/applications/[id]
- PATCH /api/applications/[id]
- DELETE /api/applications/[id]
- PATCH /api/applications/[id]/status
- GET /api/applications/stats

#### Sprint 1.3: List View UI (2 days)
**Branch:** `feature/applications-list-ui`

**Tasks:**
1. Create applications list page with:
   - Table/card layout
   - Filter by status
   - Search by company/title
   - Sort options
2. Status dropdown per row
3. Inline detail expansion
4. Loading states
5. Mobile responsive

**Estimated:** 1-2 days

#### Sprint 1.4: Browser Extension Basics (3 days)
**Branch:** `feature/extension-basic-capture`

**Tasks:**
1. Set up Vite build for extension
2. Create manifest V3
3. Build popup UI
4. LinkedIn job page parser
5. Indeed job page parser
6. API integration
7. Confirmation panel

**Estimated:** 2 days

### Timeline Estimate
- **Optimistic:** 5 days (1 week)
- **Realistic:** 8-10 days (1.5-2 weeks)
- **With buffer:** 12 days (2 weeks)

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps

### Option A: Start Database Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/database-auth-setup

# Choose your path:
# 1. Supabase (easiest, includes auth): https://supabase.com
# 2. Local PostgreSQL: brew install postgresql@15

# Once DB is ready, we'll:
# - Install Drizzle ORM
# - Create schema
# - Set up migrations
# - Add NextAuth
```

### Option B: Set Up Local Database First
```bash
# Install PostgreSQL
brew install postgresql@15
brew services start postgresql@15

# Create database
createdb application_point

# Add to webapp/.env.local:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost:5432/application_point"
```

### Option C: Use Supabase (Fastest)
1. Go to https://supabase.com and create project
2. Copy connection string
3. Add to `webapp/.env.local`
4. We get: DB + Auth + Storage for free

---

## 🔄 Development Workflow Reminder

### Daily Workflow
```bash
# 1. Start from clean main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# 3. Develop with small commits
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user schema"

# 4. Test before pushing
pnpm test
pnpm type-check

# 5. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/your-feature
# Open PR on GitHub
```

### Branch Naming
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes  
- `refactor/` - Code improvements
- `test/` - Test additions
